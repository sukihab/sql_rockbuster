# sql_rockbuster_project
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

### Objective
Come up with data-driven launch strategy for the new online video service. 

The first task is to load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions. Additionally, a Data-Dictionary has to be created for the relational database. And finally, the key findings and suggestions needs to be presented in a powerpoint presentation. 

### Data
The dataset is a relational database made-up of 15 tables:
1. rental
2. inventory
3. payment
4. film
5. film_category
6. cateregory
7. language
8. film_actor
9. actor
10. staff
11. store
12. customer
13. address
14. city
15. country

Refer to the Data-Dictionary for details. 

### Tools

To execute this project I have used the following tools:
- PostgreSQL
- Tableau
- MS-Excel
- MS-Power Point
